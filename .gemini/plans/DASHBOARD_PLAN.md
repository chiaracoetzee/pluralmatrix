# PluralMatrix Dashboard: Implementation Plan 🌌

This plan covers the development of the web-based configuration dashboard for PluralMatrix, allowing users to manage their systems and members natively on Matrix.

## 1. Architecture
*   **Backend:** Node.js (Express) integrated into the existing App Service.
*   **Database:** PostgreSQL (via Prisma).
*   **Frontend:** React (Vite) + Tailwind CSS.
*   **Authentication:** Matrix-based login (verifying against Synapse) + JWT session management.

## 2. Phase 1: Authentication Engine 🔐
**Goal:** Allow users to log in with their Matrix ID and password to securely manage their system.

*   [ ] Install JWT dependencies (`jsonwebtoken`).
*   [ ] Implement `POST /api/auth/login` endpoint:
    *   Authenticates with Synapse using standard Matrix Login API.
    *   On success, generates a signed JWT containing the user's MXID.
*   [ ] Implement `authenticateToken` middleware to protect future API routes.
*   [ ] Create automated tests for the login flow.

## 3. Phase 2: Member CRUD API 📝
**Goal:** Backend logic for managing system members.

*   [ ] Implement `GET /api/members`: Fetch all system members for the logged-in user.
*   [ ] Implement `POST /api/members`: Create a new system member.
*   [ ] Implement `PATCH /api/members/:id`: Update system member attributes.
*   [ ] Implement `DELETE /api/members/:id`: Remove a system member.
*   [ ] Implement avatar upload handling (Proxying to Matrix Media Repo).

## 4. Phase 3: PluralKit Importer 🚀
**Goal:** Seamless migration from Discord.

*   [ ] Implement `POST /api/import/pluralkit`:
    *   Parse PluralKit JSON export.
    *   Map fields to PluralMatrix schema.
    *   **Avatar Migration:** Download external images and re-upload to local Matrix server.
    *   Bulk-insert/upsert into database.

## 5. Phase 4: Frontend UI 🎨
**Goal:** A polished, modern dashboard.

*   [ ] Setup Tailwind CSS.
*   [ ] Build Login Page.
*   [ ] Build System Dashboard (Stats & System Name).
*   [ ] Build Member Grid (Cards with avatars).
*   [ ] Build System Member Editor (Forms for editing tags, names, etc.).
*   [ ] Build Import UI (Drag & Drop JSON).

## 6. Verification Steps
*   **Backend:** Automated Jest tests for API endpoints.
*   **Manual:** Verification via `curl` and eventually the browser UI.
